Overview
========

As portable chest X-rays are an efficient means of triaging emergent cases, their increased use has raised the question as to whether imaging carries additional prognostic utility for survival among patients with COVID-19. This study assessed the importance of known risk factors on in-hospital mortality and to investigate the predictive utility of radiomic texture features using various machine learning approaches.  We detected incremental improvements in survival prognostication utilizing texture features derived from emergent chest X-rays, particularly among older patients or those with higher comorbidity burden. Important features included age, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and certain comorbid conditions, as well as image features related to the intensity and variability of the pixel distribution. Thus, widely available chest X-rays, in conjunction with clinical information, may be predictive of survival outcomes of patients with COVID-19, especially older, sicker patients, and can aid in disease management by providing additional information.

Requirements
============

The project has been tested on Python 3.8.8 with `Scikit-learn == 0.17.2` , `Pandas == 1.3.4` and `Numpy == 1.20.1`.
